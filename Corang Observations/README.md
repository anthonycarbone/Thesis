These observations were made in the Corang on 30th March 2024 using an iPhone 11 Pro on night mode.

Location: -35.27694038106614Â°, 150.12291432766304Â°, 733 m elevation (obtained from Google Maps after the fact).

All times below in Australian Eastern Daylight Savings Time (AEDT) (UTC+11).

Below is a summary of the results, it includes for each observation set:
- The image filenames
- For each image:
    - The nova.astrometry.net link to its astrometry result
    - Time taken in AEDT (according to iPhone 11 Pro image timestamp)
    - The approximate Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) of the centre of the satellite streak in the image obtained from manually analysing the FITS files in DS9.
- And for the observation set as a whole:
    - The presumed satellite from matching with historical TLEs
    - The results for the closest preceding and following historical TLEs of said satellite, including:
        - The average error (between the observation and the predicted location according to the TLE) calculated as
        $$ \text{AvgError} = \frac 1 n \Sigma_i^n \sqrt{( \alpha_{\text{TLE}_i} - \alpha_{\text{obs}_i} )^2 + ( \delta_{\text{TLE}_i} - \delta_{\text{obs}_i} )^2} $$
        - where $n$ is the number of images, $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are right ascension and declination respectively, and TLE is the predicted location propagated from the TLE and obs is the observed location
        - The TLE epoch age at the time of observation (-ve means TLE epoch after observation time)
